# Bus Demand Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the number of buses required at different times of the day for the route between Gandhipuram and Somanur in Coimbatore, considering factors such as population, holidays, and peak hours.

## Project Structure

- **/data**: Contains input data files such as demographics, bus schedules, and holidays.
- **/src**: Contains Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
- **/models**: Contains trained machine learning models.
- **/visualizations**: Stores visualizations generated during the project.
